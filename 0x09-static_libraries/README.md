0x09-static_libraries
This repository contains the source code for the tasks of the 0x09-static_libraries project in the ALX Low Level Programming course.

Tasks
0-isupper.c: Write a function that checks if a character is uppercase.
0-memset.c: Write a function that fills a memory area with a constant byte.
0-strcat.c: Write a function that concatenates two strings.
1-isdigit.c: Write a function that checks if a character is a digit.
1-memcpy.c: Write a function that copies a memory area.
1-strncat.c: Write a function that concatenates two strings, but only up to a certain number of characters.
100-atoi.c: Write a function that converts a string to an integer.
2-strchr.c: Write a function that finds the first occurrence of a character in a string.
2-strlen.c: Write a function that returns the length of a string.
2-strncpy.c: Write a function that copies a string, but only up to a certain number of characters.
3-islower.c: Write a function that checks if a character is lowercase.
3-puts.c: Write a function that prints a string to the standard output.
3-strcmp.c: Write a function that compares two strings.
3-strspn.c: Write a function that returns the length of the initial segment of a string consisting only of characters from a specified set.
4-isalpha.c: Write a function that checks if a character is alphabetic.
4-strpbrk.c: Write a function that searches a string for a character from a specified set.
5-strstr.c: Write a function that finds the first occurrence of a substring in a string.
6-abs.c: Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
9-strcpy.c: Write a function that copies a string.
_putchar.c: Write a function that writes a character to the standard output.
How to use
To compile the source code, run the following command in the repository directory:

gcc -std=gnu89 -c *.c


To create the static library, run the following command:

ar -rc libmy.a *.o

To use the static library in your own code, you can link it with the -lmy flag. For example, the following command will compile and link a program called my_program that uses the static library:

gcc -std=gnu89 my_program.c -lmy -o my_program
